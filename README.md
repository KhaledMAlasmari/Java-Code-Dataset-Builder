# Java Code Dataset Builder

This was an assignment for an AI course that I took. We were given around 2800 assignments for an introductory programming course, and were asked to make a dataset out of them.


## Usage

Install the requirements using pip
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Dump the java files into a new directory named submissions , and run the program.
```
python main.py
```

## Example dataset
I've included the dataset and the report that I submitted to the professor, but I had to remove student ids for obvious reasons.
